Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I used Postgresql to clean and process the data,
and I used Power BI to analyze and visualize the processed data.

The main goal of this analysis is to find out how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bike differently by analyzing the data of the last 12 months
